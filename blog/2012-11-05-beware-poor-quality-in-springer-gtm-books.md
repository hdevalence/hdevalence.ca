title: Beware poor quality in Springer GTM books

Compare and contrast the following pictures of text, from two Springer GTM books.

This is from Silverman’s *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*:

<div>
[![Silverman’s *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*][silv_sm]][silv_lg]
</div>

And this is from Hartshorne’s *Algebraic Geometry*:

<div>
[![Hartshorne’s *Algebraic Geometry*][hart_sm]][hart_lg]
</div>

Both are the editions currently for sale – but one is cleanly 
printed, while the other is a low-quality scan of the original book.
