# Henry de Valence

Bio goes here, or something. I'm an MSc student at Queen's University,
interested in algebra, geometry, and number theory.  
I've been a sometime contributor to [KDE][4] since 2007, but now I mostly spend
my free time climbing at the [Kingston Bouldering Cooperative][1].

Feel free to get in touch by clicking on the “Email” button above.

Or if you're curious, you can view [the source][3] for this page,
written in Haskell with [Hakyll][5].
