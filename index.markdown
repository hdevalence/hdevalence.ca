# Henry de Valence

I like to make stuff and learn things. This is my website.

I'm a mathematics undergrad at Queen's University, interested 
in algebra, geometry, and number theory.  This past
summer I worked on [KStars][1] as part of [Google Summer of Code 2013][2].
I've been a [KDE][4] contributor since 2007.
Hobbies include reading, programming, open-source, climbing, and cycling.

Feel free to get in touch by clicking on the “Email” button above.

Or if you're curious, you can view [the source][3] for this page,
written in Haskell with [Hakyll][5].
